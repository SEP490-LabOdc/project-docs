# Context & Problem Statement

In the era of digital transformation and globalization, businesses increasingly need access to high-quality IT talent while optimizing costs.

The Offshore Development Center (ODC) model allows businesses to hire remote development teams from different countries, facilitating flexible and efficient project implementation.

However, recruiting, training, and managing IT personnel under the ODC model still faces many challenges due to the lack of a comprehensive support system:

- Businesses struggle to find and select IT candidates who meet project requirements.
- There are gaps in training and enhancing IT staff skills to meet international business standards.
- Managing remote work processes, contracts, and performance evaluations becomes complex without an integrated system.
- The absence of a unified platform to connect businesses, candidates, and training providers leads to inefficiency.

# Our Solution

## LabOdc: Next-Generation ODC Platform

The **Lab-based ODC Platform (LabOdc)** model is a unique combination of high-quality personnel training and software development team provision following the **Offshore Development Center (ODC)** model for businesses.

* **Operating mini-ODC Teams:** Trainees are organized into development teams (mini-ODC Teams) right within the Lab, directly guided by experienced **mentors/seniors** to ensure output quality.

### Benefits for Businesses
With LabOdc, businesses can:
* **Save Time and Cost:** Quickly obtain a development team with the right expertise without spending initial training costs and time.
* **Flexible Management:** Directly manage team progress and work through the platform.
* **Quality Assurance:** LabOdc serves as a bridge and guarantor, managing the entire process from recruitment and training to handover.
